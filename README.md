# Maze Solver
This Python-based maze solver uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to find a solution to a given maze. It currently works on the provided sample image and outputs the solved path.

## Features:
- Solves mazes using recursive backtracking
- Accepts image-based input for maze configuration

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Rxylon/maze-solver.git`
2. Run the script with the provided maze image: `python maze_solver.py`

## Future Improvements:
- Expand to handle custom maze images and formats
